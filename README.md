# Spend Jay Z's Money 

I wanted to build an app using **Vue.js**, **Vuex** and **Tailwind CSS**. So here it is! It's a pretty simple app where you can use Jay Z's net worth to purchase and sell the listed items. I was inspired by this app when I followed another developer on Github who built a similar app titled [Spend Jeff Bezo's Money](https://spend-jeff-bezos-money.netlify.com). I believe she was also inspired by the original version [Spend Bill Gate's Money](https://neal.fun/spend/)

Here's the [demo](https://dazzling-almeida-9c3938.netlify.com/)

## Tech Stack
* Vue.js
* Vuex
* Tailwind CSS
* Netlify (for the CI/build and hosting)



Well, I hope you enjoy. I think I was able to catch any edge cases but if you find something. Feel free to let me know or submit a PR.
